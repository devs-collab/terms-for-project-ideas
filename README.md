DevsCollab ("us", "we", or "our") maintains the DevsCollab OpenSource Community (the "Service").

This page informs you of our terms and conditions for bering a member of the #project-ideas channel on Devs Collab Discord Server. By using the channel you accept these terms.


## For Ideators

> ### If Your Idea is Used For a Project

Acceptance of the idea for a project suggests that the project now belongs to the entire DevsCollab OpenSource Community as an Opensource project. However, the sole concept of the idea belongs to the one who proposed it. So, the ideator will be credited for the idea behind the project and the entire prject will remain an opensource entity.

> ### If Your Idea is not Used For any Project

Rights for the pending ideas will solely remain with the ideator.

## For all Members

Every member of the channel must respect the concern of ownership and credits of the idea for the ideator.

Under no cicumstances can the members use the idea shared on the channel elsewhere without an official discussion with the maintainers and the ideator.

Any objections on the shared idea, shall be raised within the 30 days period of sharing of the idea by the ideator, irrespective of any circumstances. Objections may be about the originality of the idea or the owner of the idea and it shall be conveyed to both the ideator and the maintainers.

### DevsCollab will not be answerable to any disputes and/or vioaltions of these terms of the ownership of ideas but legal actions will be taken by the community to curb such unethical activities.
